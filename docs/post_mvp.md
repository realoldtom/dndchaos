# Post-MVP Roadmap

## Phase 6: Campaign Planner (Prep)
- **Encounter Composer**: drag-and-drop templates for monsters/NPCs  
- **Scenario Builder**: outline scenes, set objectives, and assign difficulty  
- **Pre-session Export**: generate a session brief (PDF/Markdown) for DM reference  

## Phase 7: Session Runtime (Live Play)
- **Live Dice-Roller Widget**: integrated d20/d6 rolls with auto-log  
- **Event Queue & Alerts**: real-time notifications for turn changes, status effects  
- **Voice Notes & Transcripts**: record quick scene notes and auto-transcribe for logs  

## Phase 8: Campaign Tracker (Post-Session Logging)
- **Session Log Export**: compile actions, rolls, and notes into a shareable document  
- **XP & Loot Dashboard**: track experience, treasure, and leveling across sessions  
- **Narrative Timeline**: visualize story arcs, NPC interactions, and major events  

## Phase 9: Content Library (Shared Assets)
- **Asset Repository**: centralized store for monsters, items, maps, handouts  
- **Search & Tagging**: filter assets by type, level, theme, or custom tags  
- **Template Sharing**: import/export reusable encounter and NPC templates  

## Phase 10: Integration Hub (APIs & Tools)
- **Obsidian Sync**: two-way sync of session notes and character files  
- **SRD / D&D Beyond API**: pull official monsters, spells, and items on demand  
- **Future Backend (Optional)**: multi-user state sync, authentication, and cloud persistence  

> **Post-MVP Vision:** Build on the Chaos Manager core to cover the full DM workflowâ€”plan, play, log, share assets, and connect to the wider D&D ecosystem.
